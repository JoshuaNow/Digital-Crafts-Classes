   <br> <li>The way she moves, she's like a belly-dancer. She's shaking that ass to the new Nelly jams. I think someone's at the door but I don't think I'mma answer.

                When you walked through the door. It was clear to me (Clear to me). You’re the one they adore. Who they came to see (Who they came to see). You’re a rock star (Baby). Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you). Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?). We’re the ones who made you.

    <li>My tea's gone cold. I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window. And I can't see at all. And even if I could it'd all be gray. But your picture on my wall. It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad.</li>
    <li>I'm not afraid to take a stand. Everybody, come take my hand. We'll walk this road together, through the storm. Whatever weather, cold or warm. Just lettin' you know that you're not alone. Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road.</li>
