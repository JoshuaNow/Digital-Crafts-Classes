<section class="blog-content" id="post_1"> My tea's gone cold. I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window. And I can't see at all. And even if I could it'd all be gray. But your picture on my wall. It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad.If you could count the skeletons in my closet. Under my bed and up under my faucet. Then you would know I've completely lost it. Is he nuts? No, he's insane. If you could count the skeletons in my closet. Under my bed and up under my faucet.

    <section class="blog-content" id="post_2"> I'm not afraid to take a stand. Everybody, come take my hand. We'll walk this road together, through the storm. Whatever weather, cold or warm. Just lettin' you know that you're not alone. Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road.</section>
<div class="comments">Mom, I know I let you down. And though you say the days are happy. Why is the power off and I'm fucked up?. And, Mom, I know he's not around. But don't you place the blame on me. As you pour yourself another drink, yeah. I guess we are who we are. Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on. Maybe we took this too far.</div>
