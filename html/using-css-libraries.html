        <p>Mom, I know I let you down. 
        And though you say the days are happy. 
        Why is the power off and I'm fucked up?. 
        And, Mom, I know he's not around. 
        But don't you place the blame on me.
        As you pour yourself another drink, yeah. 
        I guess we are who we are. Headlights shining in the dark night,
        I drive on. Maybe we took this too far.
